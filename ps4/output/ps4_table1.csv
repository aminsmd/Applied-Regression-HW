"SD = Standard Deviation, Note. The sample is restricted to those with no missing data on any of the variables presented.  Test scores are normalized IRT scores, standardized to a mean of 0 and SD of 1 in the full, unrestricted sample. Standard deviations are only presented for continuous variables."
